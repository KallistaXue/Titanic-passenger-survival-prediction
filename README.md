# Titanic Passenger Survival Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project that aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The project utilizes various data analysis and machine learning techniques to analyze the Titanic dataset and build a predictive model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes information about the Titanic passengers, such as age, gender, class, fare paid, and survival status. The main goal is to use this data to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model building and evaluation
- Predictive analysis

## Requirements
To run the notebooks and scripts in this repository, you will need the following:
